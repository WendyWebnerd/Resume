    <li><h2>Summary</h2></li>
    <p>After spending 27 years in the Banking and Finance industry, I discovered a passion for web design that transformed my professional journey. Over the past decade, my interests led me to embark on various side projects, each starting with the creation of a website. Using platforms like WordPress and Elementor, I found joy in crafting visually appealing and functional online spaces.

        This passion grew into something more substantial when I volunteered to manage the website for my local Women's Shed. It was a rewarding experience that solidified my enthusiasm for web design and my desire to pursue it further.
        
        Currently, I am enhancing my skills through a Full Stack Web Developer course on Udemy. This program allows me to deepen my understanding of web technologies and create professional-grade projects, including this personal resume website.
        
        I am excited to merge my professional expertise, creativity, and technical knowledge to build impactful web experiences. This is more than a career shiftâ€”it's the realization of a path I am truly passionate about.</p>
